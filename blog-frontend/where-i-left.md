//Make a new DB which has the category vs header toggle status
//correct your curret db as category should not be an array.
//by default we may put any 5 arrays in the subheader if user has not specified any.
//give user an option to see all distinct arrays and then out of those just toggle(max 5) which he wants on subheader.
//blog DB and category Vs subheader DB are eentirely different.
// in nav bar, if categoryVd subheader navbar is null, then pick any five, else just filter category based on those which are present in the db.
